# DU-Screen-Simulator
A very WIP beta simulator meant to mimic new DU screen functionality


Current Progress: Most functions are written, but there are some bugs in how I'm handling the 'Next' functions, like 'setNextFillColor', which makes them apply in reverse order and generally wrong.

Major cleanups should be done
